# CommanderBot Overall

### **A better way to plan in-game events**
CommanderBot is a Discord bot developed to help clans manage their group operations like Raids, PvP, PvE, missions and many more things that are focused on the needs of several clans.

An Events(Operations) purpose bot, this bot is the best to schedule events.

**IMPORTANT**
*There must be a category channel called **Operations**.*

## TimeZone management
+ Use `!tzset {-11 to +14}` to set up your TimeZone (default is GMT+0).
+ Use `!tzget` to see your TimeZone.

## Finding Operations
+ Use `!ops [filter]` to see available operations

*Example*:

+ `!ops` - i will show you all registered operations.
+ `!ops raid` - i will filter and show you only **raid** operations.

## Joining, leaving or looking into an Operation
+ Use `!join {group-id}` to join an operation
+ Use `!leave {group-id}` to leave an operation
+ Use `!info {group-id}` to see an operation

## Creating an Operation
**IMPORTANT**
*Before creating an operation, make sure to **set your timezone.***

+ Use `!create {operation} {date}` to create an operation.

*Example*:

+ `!create Casual Matches tomorrow at 4pm`
+ `!create Raid Sunday at 19:00`
+ `!create Coin Farming 17 August 2013 from 4pm to 7pm`
+ `!create PVP DarkZone Friday from 13:00 - 16.00`
+ `!create Epic Boss in two weeks from now at 18:30`
+ `!create Ranking Matches Sat Aug 17 2013 18:40:39 GMT+0900 (JST)`
+ `!create Grinding Gear 2014-11-30T08:15:30-05:30`

*i remind you as private messages 1 hour, 30 min and 10 min before the operation.*
